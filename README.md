"Welcome to my GitHub repository, a dedicated space where I've shared the results of my six-month internship journey at INSA University, France. During this enlightening experience, under the supervision of Dr. Vincent Hugot, I delved into model building, automata, and verification tools, gaining invaluable insights into model checking CTL, Python, and a plethora of mathematical and magical concepts, including inductive structures. The repository encapsulates the knowledge, projects, and achievements I've gathered during this internship, reflecting my commitment to advancing these fields of study. Feel free to explore the contributions and discoveries made during my time at INSA University, as I continue to build on the foundation laid during this enriching experience."
